# Video-Streaming-as-a-Web-Service
Video streams are encoded from the source and sent to a server which decodes it and relays it to the clients. The media is sent as a continuous stream of data and is played as it arrives. The application encodes the video from Webcams and relays it to the server which in turn decodes it and displays it to the user.
